It is shown that every strongly Baire space is a Namioka space and\nevery $\\beta-\\sigma$-unfavorable space is a strongly Baire space.",

    "summary": "A basic concept of Type Two Theory of Effectivity (TTE) is the notion of an\nadmissibly represented space. Admissibly represented spaces are closely related\nto qcb-spaces. The latter form a well-behaved subclass of topological spaces.\nWe give a survey of basic facts about Type Two Theory of Effectivity,\nadmissibly represented spaces, qcb-spaces and effective qcb-spaces. Moreover,\nwe discuss the relationship of qcb-spaces to other categories relevant to\nComputable Analysis.",

We\nshow how to exploit this approach to solve interpolation problems in the Fock\nspace.",

    "summary": "This paper establishes that multilinear Calder\\'on--Zygmund operators and\ntheir maximal operators are bounded on Hardy spaces associated with ball\nquasi-Banach function spaces. Moreover, we also obtain the boundedness of\nmultilinear pseudo-differential operators on local Hardy spaces associated with\nball quasi-Banach function spaces. Since these (local) Hardy type spaces\nencompass a wide range of classical (local) Hardy-type spaces including\nweighted (local) Hardy spaces, variable (local) Hardy space, (local)\nHardy--Morrey space, mixed-norm (local) Hardy space, (local) Hardy--Lorentz\nspace and (local) Hardy--Orlicz spaces, the results presented in this paper are\nhighly general and essentially improve the existing results.",

Combining Smarandache multi-spaces with\nlinear vector spaces in classical linear algebra, the conception of\nmulti-vector spaces is introduced. Some characteristics of a multi-vector space\nare obtained in this paper.",
