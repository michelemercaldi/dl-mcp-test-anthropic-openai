💡 Key Advantages for Your Train Production Scenario

Complex Queries Made Simple: "Build skeleton for 8 trains" → Agent automatically searches similar projects, gets statistics, scales estimates
Historical Intelligence: Learns from past projects to provide accurate estimates
Safety First: Engineering phases require specific patterns - tools enforce this
Scalable: Works for simple queries ("how many phases?") and complex analysis

The MCP architecture gives you the perfect balance of AI power with enterprise-grade security and control. Your database stays protected, queries are auditable, and you can switch AI providers anytime!
